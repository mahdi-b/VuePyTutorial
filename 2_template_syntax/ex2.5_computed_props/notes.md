* Instead of using complex logic in {{}}, you should use a computed property. E.g.:

```
    # instead of 
    <p>Reversed message is {{" ".join(self.message.split()[::-1])}} </p>
    # do
    <p>Reversed message is {{reversedMessage}} </p>
    # with
    @computed
    def reversedMessage(self):
        return " ".join(self.message.split()[::-1])
```



* Vue is aware that reversedMessage depends on message, so it will update any bindings that depend on reversedMessage when message changes. 

And the best part is that weâ€™ve created this dependency relationship declaratively: the computed getter function has no side effects, which makes it easier to test and understand.




* The following computed property will never update, because Date.now() is not a reactive dependency:
```
    @computed
    def now(self):
        return time.time()
```
